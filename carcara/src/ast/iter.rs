//! This module implements `ProofIter`, an iterator that recursively iterates over the proof
//! commands in a proof.

use super::*;

/// An iterator over the proof commands in a proof.
///
/// This struct traverses the proof recursively, yielding all proof commands in order. When
/// encountering a subproof, the iterator first yields the `ProofCommand::Subproof`, and then
/// iterates through the subproofs commands.
///
/// This struct is created by the [`iter`](Proof::iter) method on proofs.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use carcara::*;
/// # fn main() -> CarcaraResult<()> {
/// let proof = "
///     (assume h1 (forall ((x Int)) (> x 0)))
///     (assume h2 (not (forall ((y Int)) (> y 0))))
///     (anchor :step t3 :args ((y Int) (:= x y)))
///     (step t3.t1 (cl (= x y)) :rule refl)
///     (step t3.t2 (cl (= (> x 0) (> y 0))) :rule cong :premises (t3.t1))
///     (step t3 (cl (= (forall ((x Int)) (> x 0)) (forall ((y Int)) (> y 0)))) :rule bind)
///     (step t4 (cl (not (forall ((x Int)) (> x 0))) (forall ((y Int)) (> y 0)))
///         :rule equiv1 :premises (t3))
///     (step t5 (cl) :rule resolution :premises (t4 h1 h2))
/// "
/// .as_bytes();
/// let (_, proof, _) = parser::parse_instance("".as_bytes(), proof, true, false, false)?;
/// let ids: Vec<_> = proof.iter().map(|c| c.id()).collect();
/// assert_eq!(ids, ["h1", "h2", "t3", "t3.t1", "t3.t2", "t3", "t4", "t5"]);
/// # Ok(())
